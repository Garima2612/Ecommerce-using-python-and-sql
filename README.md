# Ecommerce-using-python-and-sql
Overview: This project demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data challenges by building an end-to-end data analysis pipeline. I imported raw data from multiple CSV files into a structured MySQL database, executed complex SQL queries to extract meaningful insights, and utilized Python for advanced data visualization.

Key Components:

1.Data Import and Cleaning: 
Imported over 7 CSV files containing customer, order, product, payment, and seller information into a MySQL database.
Cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy, including handling missing values and standardizing column names.

2.Database Management:
Designed and structured a relational database to efficiently store and query the imported data.
Created tables with optimized data types to enhance query performance.

3.SQL Queries and Analysis:
Executed complex SQL queries to address business-critical questions:
Identified sales trends across product categories.
Analyzed customer purchasing behavior and retention rates.
Assessed the correlation between product pricing and purchase frequency.
Leveraged window functions to compute moving averages and year-over-year growth rates.

4.Data Visualization with Python:
Utilized Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to create compelling visual representations of the data.
Visualized key metrics such as customer distribution by state, monthly sales trends, and revenue contribution by product category.

5.Key Insights:
Provided actionable insights like identifying top-performing sellers, high-demand product categories, and customer behavior trends that can drive business strategies.


Tools and Technologies:

1.Database: MySQL
2.Programming Language: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
3.SQL Techniques: Joins, Window Functions, CTEs, Aggregations, Subqueries
